# A/B Testing

This is the sixth project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257-nd) course from Udacity.  In this project we analyze an experiment similar to one performed at Udacity.  The experiment involves testing for a change in the onboarding process.  Evaluation metrics are chosen and characterized for the experiment.  Then analysis is conducted on the results using a variety of statistical techniques.  Ultimately, we make a launch recommendation based upon upon results and our analysis.

During the analysis phase, I derived a sample size calculator and created a web app which can be seen via this repo:
