# A/B Testing

This is the sixth project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree and accompanies the [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257-nd) course from Udacity.  In this project we analyze an experiment similar to one performed at Udacity in which a change in the onboarding process is tested.  We choose and characterize metrics to evaluate the experiment and analyze the results using a variety of statistical techniques to make a launch recommendation.
