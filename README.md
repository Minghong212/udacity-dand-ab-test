# A/B Testing

This was the 6th project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.  The coursework and final project are for the [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257-nd) course.  In this project we analyzed an experiment similar to one performed at Udacity.  The experiment involved testing for a change in the onboarding process.  We chose evaluation metrics for the experiment and analyzed results using a variety of statistical techniques.  Ultimately, we made a launch recommendation based upon the results of our analysis.

During the analysis phase, I derived a sample size calculator.  The web app can be seen via this repo:
